## Certificate Authority for Mac OS X

This script creates a trusted CA on your Mac and signs new trusted certificates with it. These are modern certificates that will pass modern browser's heightened requirements.

### Usage
Run `bash gen-certs.sh` and you'll be walked through the rest. Mac will ask for your password to add the CA to your keychain.

To use the website, run `sudo nano /etc/hosts` and add the following lines:

```
127.0.0.1       server-1.com
127.0.0.1       api.server-1.com
```

### Expanding
You can sign as many server certificates as you want with this new CA on your device. Just duplicate the `server-1.cnf` and duplicate the last two lines of `gen-certs.sh`.

### Tips
If you're developing with Node, make sure to `export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=$(pwd)/certs/ca-crt.pem` to trust your CA.
